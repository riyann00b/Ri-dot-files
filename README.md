## Introduction

This repository provides a collection of dotfiles for configuring the Linux environment. The `.bashrc` file is used to set up the behavior and appearance of the Bash shell, including aliases, environment variables, and shell options.

## File Overview

- **`.bashrc`**: Contains custom settings for the Bash shell. This file is sourced every time a new terminal session is started.

## Installation

To use the `.bashrc` file from this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/riyann00b/Ri-dotfiles.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd linux-dotfiles
    ```

3. Copy the `.bashrc` file to your home directory:

    ```bash
    cp .bashrc ~/
    ```

4. Ensure the file is named `.bashrc` (the leading dot is crucial as it denotes a hidden file in Unix-like systems). If the file was copied with a different name, rename it:

    ```bash
    mv ~/bashrc ~/.bashrc
    ```

5. Apply the changes by sourcing the `.bashrc` file:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

## Usage

After installing the `.bashrc` file, you should see the custom settings and aliases in your terminal sessions. If you encounter any issues or want to tweak the settings, you can edit the `.bashrc` file directly.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the `.bashrc` file to better suit your needs. You can add new aliases, modify environment variables, or adjust prompt settings. If you make any improvements, consider contributing them back to this repository!
